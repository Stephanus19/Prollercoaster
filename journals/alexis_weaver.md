Today we created the group repository for our project. Earlier this week we began working on finalizing our ideas for the project. We also accomplished our wireframing for what we wanted it to look like. Yesterday we began our API Design/Endpoints but today we are working on putting them in the markdown file and adjusting them to meet the requirements of the assignment.

February 10th, 2023
Today we made sure our API design was complete and ran it by Jimmy to make sure we did it correctly. His suggestions were added/corrected. Then we all worked on completing the explorations that were released regarding FastAPI, PostgreSQL and backend authentication so we all have an understanding of that and can begin writing code for our project next week.

February 13th, 2023
Started working on Docker in the docker-compose but we didn't get it working yet.

February 14th, 2023
Got Docker working and created our tables and migrations.

February 15th, 2023
We are moving towards authentication on the back-end. We created our accounts queries and routers so that we are able to create accounts.

February 16th, 2023
We finished up writing all of our parts for authentication but struggled alot to get it working today. But we were able to work it all out and login in and out. Our authentication part is done! We started working on our favorites queries to be able to create a favorite.

February 21st
We completed our favorites. We are able to create a favorite, see the favorites based off a user and delete a favorite. All of that can only be done if you're logged in and the list of the favorites is only seen by the user that is logged in. We also worked on the CRUD to make the calls to our roller coaster api. We have all of that working for now and are able to get the roller coasters but we may need to play around with filtering the info a little more so we can pull it from the api faster. But we basically have all the backend parts done now and the goal for tomorrow is to move towards front end!

February 22nd, 2023
Began working on front end authentication. We got login to work but something still seems off with it. We spent a lot of time trying to learn what the code is saying from the cookbook.

February 23rd, 2023
We got our login and logout to work on our front end today! We also decided to start including some bootstrap so we can see things working for our login modal. Then we created our sign up modal and got that working. We also began working on our home page.

February 24th, 2023
I had to leave class a bit early today. But before I left we had started working on our front page getting our list of roller coasters to show up. When I had to leave we had everything that we were wanting to get listed out on the main page. Everything except the images of the roller coasters.

February 27th, 2023
Today we finished getting the home page to show all of the roller coaster cards correctly and started planning out our favorites list.

February 28th, 2023
Today we got our favorites page to work as an off canvas and created the delete button on each card in the favorites list to remove it from our favorites list.

March 1st, 2023
Today we got our favorites and home page fixed to where it will load when we aren't logged in. We also created our speed, height and inversions filters.

March 2nd, 2023
We created a welcome message to logged in users and the sign up modal closes when submitted and automatically has the user signed in with the welcome message. We also fixed the nav bar so it doesn't move while scrolling and added the icons for each of our filters.

March 3rd, 2023
We worked on a lot of styling today for our buttons and nav bar.

March 6th, 2023
Today we worked on getting our front page video to work while we are getting our roller coaster data from the api. Also added logos to the modals and added conversions for our speed and height of the roller coasters.

March 7th, 2023
Today we got rid of the errors that were showing up in the console and cleaned up some of the code. We also created all 3 of our unit tests since Riley told us we only had to have 3. They are for creating a favorite, getting the favorites list by user and deleting the favorite and everything is passing.

March 8th, 2023
We started trying to make our rollercoaster detail modal. And started to consider making the details of the rollercoaster on a separate page because of having trouble getting the bootstrap modal to work.

March 9th, 2023
Today we got our rollercoaster detail modal to work. We moved our favorites buttons on top of the images on the front page and on our favorites list off canvas. We also got rid of the 401 error we were having when loading the site without being logged in since it was trying to pull the favorites. We had to put the addfavorites in a conditional just like our showfavorites. We also worked on cleaning up more of the unused and commented out code.

March 10th, 2023
Today is the final day to work on our project and it's due tonight! Jimmy is coming around to see our running project today and all we really have to do is finish putting in our ReadMe and our journal entries.
