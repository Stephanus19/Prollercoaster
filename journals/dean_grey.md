2.9.23
Today we worked on our API design and discussed the completion of the wire-framing design. We came to the conclusion it seems like we will not need as many endpoints as the standard small site because our site is designed more dynamically.

2.10.23
Today we worked on our fast api design and met with Jimmy B. to discuss wireframe and API design. After our proposal was approved we started the explorations that were released.

2.13.23
Continued the exploration videos today, covering FastAPI, Authentication, and redux.

2.14.23
Resolved some docker issues and completed our tables.

2.15.23
We worked on our routes, query, and authenticator.py today.

2.16.23
Today we completed our authentication with the help of SEIRs and began our favorites.py. We had to correct that which was referenced improperly in several places.

2.21.23
Today we continued our favorites.py working on our queries and routes. Jimmy popped by early but we had only just begun. We are moving slowly but surely with some successes.

2.22.23
Today we are working on authentication and began working on the log in Modal. Started a bug log.

2.23.23
Today we finished the log in modal. With Candices help we were able to get the login in button to disappear and be replaced by the logout out button upon successful login in. We also were able to add our sign up button with functionality.

2.24.23
I drove today and we worked on the front end favorites and authentication. It was a relatively short day do to Mandatory Fun. I drove.

2.27.23
We worked on putting the site data into columns for most of the day, we corrected the favorites list routes and queries and with Louiseâ€™s help we were able to finish as verified by Swagger.

2.28.23
Today we put the favorites list on an off canvas, fixed some functionality with our api slice with Candice, added a delete favorite button with functionality and discussed our plans for the filtering of our data to the front end. I drove.

3.1.23
Today we fixed the homepage issue where the rollercoasters were not loading if you were not logged in. We also added filter buttons to our home page to sort the rollercoasters by speed, height, and inversions. We then headed to excalidraw to make sure we had a clear understanding of where our code was located and where its related code, e.g. buttons, were located.

3.2.23
Today we got the home page to display a message that welcomes the logged in user. We changed the name Sample Service to Rollercoaster Service. Removed the close button from our sign up modal and implemented a dismissal upon pressing the sign up button, added an A-Z filter button, then began the styling of our site.  
Styling included font changes, icons for filters

3.3.23
Today we continued styling including changing the navbar color, styling the login button, logout button, favorites button, remove button, and changed the alignment.

3.6.23
Today we worked on the video overlay of the loading screen, added a loading message to the video, added logos to our modals and added equations to convert our data to American metric. I drove.

3.7.23
Today we tackled 3 unit test and upon checking with Riley, he determined due to our small API that we qualified as an edge case and the 3 would be sufficient. We do still plan to add another feature. We also were able to correct all of the errors showing up in dev tools as red, and add the group name to the navbar next to our logo. Riley said!

3.8.23
Today we worked on adding a rollercoaster details feature to our cards. This took some time as we discovered it was requesting to open multiple modals as we mapped and this can not be done so we had to circumnavigate this with a useEffect.

3.9.23
Today Tyler helped us resolve our issue with having our ride details pop up in a modal. We styled a few more buttons. Fixed the 401 error when fetching and not logged in. We styled the details modal, added a filter by park alphabetically, refactored the columns code, and took out all dead code. We also added at least one Easter egg; can you find them all?

3.10.23
This morning we double checked our code for dead code and refactoring opportunities, and prepared ourselves to demo for Jimmy. We are in a great place with our project and looking forward to submitting it.
